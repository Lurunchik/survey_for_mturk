    <strong>Why we are doing this research:</strong>
    We are trying to understand how our personality affects our sense of humor.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What you will have to do:</strong>

    You will be shown 30 dialog jokes, i.e. jokes consisting of a
    question (Q) and an answer (A). You are asked to rate each joke on a 4-point
    scale: ðŸ˜ž not funny at all (1), ðŸ˜” can be better (2), ðŸ˜Š funny (3), ðŸ˜†
    hilarious (4).
    Please note that the jokes were collected from the Web with minimum
    filtering, so they may be rude or contain obscene language. Towards the end
    of the experiment, you will also be asked to answer some questions about
    yourself.
<p>
    <strong>What you will get out of it:</strong>

    We will give you feedback on how your results compare to those of others.
    We hope you will enjoy it.
